 1- what is asynchronous in js

In JavaScript, asynchronous refers to the ability of the code
to execute non-blocking operations. When an operation is asynchronous, 
it means that it can start executing, and the program can continue with
other tasks without waiting for its completion. JavaScript achieves this behavior 
through various mechanisms,
 such as callbacks, promises, and async/await.


 3- why do we need asynchronous in JavaScript

 Dependency Management: Asynchronous patterns like callbacks, promises, and async/await provide 
 effective mechanisms for managing dependencies between operations. They enable you to express 
 and handle dependencies, ensuring that code execution occurs in the correct order, even when 
 dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.Overall, asynchronous programming is essential
  for building performant, responsive, and scalable applications.
