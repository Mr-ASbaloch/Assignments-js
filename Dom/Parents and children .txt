<html> is the child of the document...<head> and <body> are the
children of <html>...<div> is the child of <body>...two <p>'s are the children of <div>...each
text node is the child of a <p>. Conversely, the document is the parent of <html>, <html> is
the parent of <head> and <body>, <head> is the parent of <title>, <title> is the parent of a
text node, and so on. Nodes with the same parent are known as siblings. So, <head> and
<body> are siblings because < html> is the parent of both. The two <p>'s are siblings because
<div> is the parent of both.
Starting at the bottom of the chart, the text "Nor to this." is a child of <p>, which is a child
of <div>, which is a child of <body>, which is a child of <html>, which is a child of the
document.
Now look at this markup.
<p>This is <em>important</em>!</p>
If you made a chart for this paragraph, you might think that all the text is a child of the <p>
node. But remember, every node that is enclosed by another node is the child of the node that
encloses it. Since the text node "important" is enclosed by the element node <em>, this
particular text node is the child of <em>, not <p>. The text nodes "This is " and "!" as well as
the element node <em> are siblings, because they're all enclosed by <p>. They're all children
of <p>.
